### Library Introduction

> Theano is a numerical computation library for Python.In Theano, computations are expressed using 
> a NumPy-esque syntax and compiled to run efficiently on either CPU or GPU architectures.

> TensorFlow is an open-source software library for machine learning across a range of tasks, and developed 
> by Google to meet their needs for systems capable of building and training neural networks to detect and 
> decipher patterns and correlations, analogous to the learning and reasoning which humans use

> Keras is an open source neural network library written in Python. It is capable of running on top of MXNet,
> Deeplearning4j, Tensorflow, CNTK or Theano.[1][2] Designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural 
> networks, it focuses on being minimal, modular and extensible

## Naive Bayes' Classifier

```Naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple probabilistic classifiers based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.
```

##### Upgraded version of Decision tree is random forest, gradient boosting

## Random Forest Classification

```
Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble ( a group of items viewed as a whole rather than individually ) learning method for classification, regression and other tasks, that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.
```

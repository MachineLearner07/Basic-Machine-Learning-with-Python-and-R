## What is Machine Learning ?
##### According to Tom Michel :
	A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

##### According to Arthur Samuel :
	Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitely programmed.

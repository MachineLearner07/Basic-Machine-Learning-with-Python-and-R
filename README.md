## Part 1.2 - Data Preprocessing 

Data pre-processingis an important step in thedata miningprocess. The phrase"garbage in, garbage out"is particularly applicable to data mining andmachine learningprojects. Data-gathering methods are often loosely controlled, resulting inout-of-rangevalues (e.g., Income: ?100), impossible data combinations (e.g., Sex: Male, Pregnant: Yes),missing values, etc. Analyzing data that has not been carefully screened for such problems can produce misleading results. Thus, the representation andquality of datais first and foremost before running an analysis. 

If there is much irrelevant and redundant information present or noisy and unreliable data, thenknowledge discoveryduring the training phase is more difficult. Data preparation and filtering steps can take considerable amount of processing time. Data pre-processing includescleaning,Instance selection,normalization,transformation,feature extractionandselection, etc. The product of data pre-processing is the finaltraining set. Kotsiantis et al. (2006) present a well-known algorithm for each step of data pre-processing. 

Data Preparation = Data Cleansing + Feature Engineering 



## Part 2.2  Regression 

Regression models (both linear and non-linear) are used for predicting a real value, like salary for example. If yourindependent variable is time, then you are forecasting future values, otherwise your model is predicting present butunknown values. Regression technique vary from Linear Regression to SVR and RandomForests Regression. 
In this part, you will understand and learn how to implement the following Machine Learning Regression models: 
1. Simple Linear Regression 
2. Multiple Linear Regression 
3. Polynomial Regression 
4. Support Vector for Regression (SVR) 
5. Decision Tree Classification 
6. Random Forest Classification

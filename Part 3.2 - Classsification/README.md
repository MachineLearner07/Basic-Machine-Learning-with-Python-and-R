## Part 3 - Classification

Unlike regression where you predict a continuous number, you use classification to predict a category. There is a wide variety of classification applications from medicine to marketing. Classification models include **linear** models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and **nonlinear** *ones like K-NN, Kernel SVM and Random Forests*.

In this part, you will understand and learn how to implement the following Machine Learning Classification models:

   [**1. Logistic Regression**](https://github.com/MachineLearner07/Basic-Machine-Learning-with-Python-and-R/tree/rezwan/Part%203.2%20-%20Classsification/1.%20Logistic%20Regression)

   [**2. K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)**](https://github.com/MachineLearner07/Basic-Machine-Learning-with-Python-and-R/tree/rezwan/Part%203.2%20-%20Classsification/2.%20K-Nearest%20Neighbors%20(K-NN))

   [**3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)**](https://github.com/MachineLearner07/Basic-Machine-Learning-with-Python-and-R/tree/rezwan/Part%203.2%20-%20Classsification/3.%20Support%20Vector%20Machine%20(SVM))

   [**4. Kernel SVM**](https://github.com/MachineLearner07/Basic-Machine-Learning-with-Python-and-R/tree/rezwan/Part%203.2%20-%20Classsification/4.%20Kernel%20SVM)

   [**5. Naive Bayes**](https://github.com/MachineLearner07/Basic-Machine-Learning-with-Python-and-R/tree/rezwan/Part%203.2%20-%20Classsification/5.%20Naive%20Bayes)

   [**6. Decision Tree Classification**](https://github.com/MachineLearner07/Basic-Machine-Learning-with-Python-and-R/tree/rezwan/Part%203.2%20-%20Classsification/6.%20Decision%20Tree%20Classification)

   [**7. Random Forest Classification**](https://github.com/MachineLearner07/Basic-Machine-Learning-with-Python-and-R/tree/rezwan/Part%203.2%20-%20Classsification/7.%20Random%20Forest%20Classification)
